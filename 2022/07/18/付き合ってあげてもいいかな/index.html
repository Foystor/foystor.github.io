<p>It has been serialized since August 31, 2018 on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://urasunday.com/title/603"><strong>裏サンデー(<em>Ura Sunday</em>)</strong></a>, a webcomic distribution site by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.shogakukan.co.jp/books/volume/47807"><strong>小學館(<em>Shogakukan</em>)</strong></a>, and on <strong>マンガワン(<em>MangaONE</em>)</strong>, a free manga application for smartphones. Eight volumes have been published to date (as of July 2022) and it’s not yet completed.</p>

<p>It is a romance manga about two college girls who start dating because <strong>it so happens that they both like women</strong> and the relationships that surround them.</p>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>Since this work is a manga dealing with love between women, Tamifull wants it to be considered one of the romance manga, so the official term “Girls Love” is used instead of “Yuri”.</p>
<p>In addition, the work is conscious of depicting realistic romantic relationships between women, and as such, it is characterized by the inclusion of kissing and sexual scenes (mainly between the main characters) and the appearance of male characters.</p>
<h1 id="Story-Summary"><a href="#Story-Summary" class="headerlink" title="Story Summary"></a>Story Summary</h1><p>Immediately after entering university, <strong>犬冢美和(<em>Miwa</em>)</strong> meets and becomes friends with <strong>猿渡冴子(<em>Saeko</em>)</strong>, who is a completely different type of person from her. Saeko invites Miwa to join a light music club, and during a conversation, Miwa and Saeko come out to each other as homosexuals. Saeko has never hated Miwa ever since they first met, so she asks Miwa if she would like to go out with her. Miwa is puzzled because she has never had romantic feelings for Saeko, but her interest in love prevails and she decides to start a relationship with Saeko.</p>

<p>Because she is a tone-deaf person, she plays the bass guitar in the club band.</p>
<p>She is popular among men. She realized in high school that she likes women, and Saeko is her first date. She lived at home for a while after the start of the story, but finally succeeded in persuading her family to let her move to live alone.</p>
<p>She is friendly and simple-minded, and is described as a “flower in the greenhouse” by her club seniors. She has a mild personality and is not good with words, but in order to “become as strong as Saeko”, she is determined to make a change.</p>
<p>A romantic who takes details seriously.</p>

</figure>

<p>She has brightly dyed hair. She was active in the light music club in high school, and plays guitar and composes music in the club band.</p>
<p>She has had relationships with both sexes. Although she experienced dating a girl in junior high school, it became a bitter memory. So she recalled that dating a man was <strong>a mistake in her desire to be “normal”</strong>, and she thinks that her first sexual experience was completely unpleasant. Rather, She even remembered the emptiness.</p>
<p>Unlike Miwa, she can communicate with anyone and is open about sex. During sexual activity, she prefers touch and doesn’t feel comfortable being touched because she thinks “feeling about sex is disgusting, and it’s not her character”.</p>

<summary style="color:red">Contains slight SPOILERS</summary>

<p>
Unlike many other Girls Love manga, How Do We Relationship does not depict the story of two girls who end up together, but the story **starts with two girls being together** and the relationship and conflicts between them.

<p>Tamifull wrote in the first volume’s afterword: “Love in reality is actually full of calculations and compromises, isn’t it? There are so few works about this kind of love.”.</p>
<p>As you can see, this manga is so real that it has brought back my buried memories of life experiences as a lesbian at all stages of my life.</p>
<p>So after reading it, I just felt <strong>sad</strong> and <strong>empty</strong>.</p>
<p>The experiences of the two main characters in the story are almost all similar to my own. I think it’s not just me, everyone who is a lesbian is pretty much the same.</p>
<!-- <br/><br/>

I got teased a lot because people thought that "I was born in the wrong body". The girl I liked said "if only you were a man".

When asked "do you have a crush on someone", even if not, I casually answered a male's name because of the atmosphere or fear of being considered "abnormal".

Thinking that it is "normal" to like men, I tried to like men.

I once took "not to confess" as my life motto.

Used family influences as an excuse for not liking men.

I had no common interests with the girls in my class who liked to talk about boys, so I tried to be united with them with an acceptable personality.

I didn't know how to reject a man for fear of revealing that I am a lesbian if he press.

I lied about being bisexual because at least I like men.

I wanted to have a girlfriend and start the next phase of my life, so I rushed in a relationship after entering college.

I was afraid to announce a new relationship. When I was asked if I have a boyfriend, I said I don't have a <abbr>boyfriend</abbr>.

When I said I had a crush, I was asked "what kind of boy is he".

When we were harassed by a male stranger, we just stayed away in silence and did not say we were a couple.

After a setback in love, I was advised to try dating a man because "I can be taken care of".

......

<br/><br/>

When I look back on those experiences, I feel ridiculous because today as a [lesbian feminist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesbian_feminism), I am proud of my sex and sexual orientation.

But before that, those are exactly what I experienced and what I thought.

To borrow the inner monologue of Saeko, **although I can not be reconciled, it is understandable**.

<br/><br/>

When I first started reading, I was expecting the main characters to respond to the events with the same mindset I have today, but no matter how much I deceived myself, I had to accept that this is the reality.

So I let down my guard to feel them, and feel the old me.

In the end, I found that **I had not been too strong, but I had chosen to forget**. -->

<p>Although many readers hope that the two main characters can finally get back together, I am not obsessed with it.</p>
<p>After a breakup, they are just as sincere in a new relationship which can also exist as a full and complete story.</p>
<p>Rather, it is more likely to be a reality if they do not get back together.</p>
<p>But in my estimation, they will.</p>
<p>Most importantly, I hope they can find a way to live their lives that gives them inner peace and happiness. It doesn’t matter who they are with, whether they are in love or not.</p>
<p>Because when society is not for us, we have to create a place where we can be ourselves.</p>
</p>

<p>Happy reading.</p>
